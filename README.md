Price calculation exercise

Create a customer basket that allows a customer to add products and provides a total cost of the
basket including applicable discounts.

Available products

Product Cost

Butter £0.8

Milk £1.15

Bread £1.00

Offers

• Buy 2 Butter and get a Bread at 50% off

• Buy 3 Milk and get the 4th milk for free


Scenarios

• Given the basket has 1 bread, 1 butter and 1 milk when I total the basket then the total
should be £2.95

• Given the basket has 2 butter and 2 bread when I total the basket then the total should be
£3.10

• Given the basket has 4 milk when I total the basket then the total should be £3.45

• Given the basket has 2 butter, 1 bread and 8 milk when I total the basket then the total
should be £9.00

The solution should be in C#.

Pointers

While we are looking for a solution that shows a good understanding of the SOLID principles, object
oriented programming (or functional) and that displays a working knowledge of TDD (a git repository
will be appreciated!), please keep things simple- do not over-engineer anything, make sure your
code is manageable and easy to follow.
If you think your solution is too short, feel free to add some commentary to justify the decisions
you've taken, if possible by quoting books, blog posts or talks that have influenced you in the way
you've coded.
Above all, code as if you're coding for yourself.
